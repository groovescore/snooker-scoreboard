Groovescore Snooker Scoreboard Web App
======================================

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application written in
JavaScript and `Svelte`_. There's no internet connection required besides
loading the page. All state is stored in browser local storage only, and never
sent anywhere.

The `documentation`_ and the `scoreboard app`_ are continuously deployed in
GitHub Pages. Additionally, there's a `development version`_ of the app built
from current main branch.
