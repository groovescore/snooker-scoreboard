Piste on Piste
==============

If you're looking for a new take on **three-player snooker rules**, and a
**scoreboard app** to go with them, you've found the right place.

Read the :ref:`rules-en`, or the Finnish translation :ref:`rules-fi`.

Launch the latest release of the `Piste on Piste scoreboard app`_.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application. After launching,
internet connection is not required. All state is stored in browser local
storage only, and never sent anywhere. The app currently works best in tablet
size screens in landscape.

There's a rudimentary :ref:`manual` for the app, covering the basics.

.. warning::

   The app is still in early stages of development, could lose track of your
   score, and may not accurately reflect the rules, especially in corner
   cases.

   Use at your own risk.

If you have any issues, questions or comments about the rules or the scoreboard
app, please see the `Piste on Piste GitHub project page`_.
