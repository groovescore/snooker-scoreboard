Three Player Snooker Rules and Scoreboard App
=============================================

This project contains special snooker rule adaptation for three players, and a
scoreboard app Piste on Piste [*]_ for the rules.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application written in
JavaScript and `Svelte`_. There's no internet connection required besides
loading the page. All state is stored in browser local storage only, and never
sent anywhere.

There's a `playground`_ for trying out the app.

*More info to come.*
