Groovescore Snooker Scoreboard
==============================

Launch the latest release of the `Snooker Scoreboard app`_.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application. After launching,
internet connection is not required. All state is stored in browser local
storage only, and never sent anywhere. The app currently works best in tablet
size screens in landscape.

.. note::

   The saved games might not work across scoreboard app versions. If you start a
   game using one version of the app, please finish it using the same
   version. The app version is visible in the URL.

If you have any issues, questions or comments about the rules or the scoreboard
app, please see the `Snooker Scoreboard GitHub project page`_.
