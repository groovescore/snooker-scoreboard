Three-Player Snooker Rules and Scoreboard App
=============================================

This project contains special snooker rule adaptation for three players, and a
scoreboard app Piste on Piste [*]_ for the rules.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application written in
JavaScript and `Svelte`_. There's no internet connection required besides
loading the page. All state is stored in browser local storage only, and never
sent anywhere.

The documentation, rules, and the scoreboard app are continuously deployed in
`GitHub Pages`_. Check it out!

Note from the Author
--------------------

While I am a professional programmer, this is purely a hobby project, if ever
there was one. I've never done anything in JavaScript or Svelte before. It's not
a pretty codebase. But I'm not sure I have much motivation to polish it either.

I'm also not much of a snooker player.
