Introduction
------------

Snooker is a game for two players or sides. If you take snooker seriously,
there's nothing for you to see here. Please move along.

With that out of the way, occasionally you do have three players who want to
spend time at the table, playing snooker against each other, having fun, instead
of taking turns waiting for the other two to finish the frame. If that sounds
like you, read on.

All three players play for themselves, have their own score, with normal scoring
rules, and the player with the highest score wins. On fouls, penalty points will
be awarded either to the preceding player, or both other players, depending on
the case, as described later.

The main difference to other three-player snooker rules out there is that the
order of play is not fixed. Instead, there are *rounds* of one turn per
player. On every round, the order of play will be from the player with the least
points scored to the player with most points.


Mode of Play
------------

The frame consists of *rounds*. Each player has one *turn* per round, except
that a player may be asked by the next player to play again after any foul.

#. The players shall agree on the order of play for the first round.

#. For each subsequent round, the order of play shall be from the player with
   least points at the end of the previous round to the player with most points.

#. Players with equal points shall keep their respective order.

#. Changes in points or the order of gaining points during a round are
   irrelevant; only the score at the end of the round matters for determining
   the order of play.

#. If the last player of a round commits a foul, and is requested to play again
   (see `Play Again`_) by the first player of the next round, the additional
   turn occurs at the beginning of the next round. Any points or penalty points
   of the additional turn(s) do not impact the order of play until the end of
   the new round.

#. It is possible that the points leader falls last during a round, i.e. from
   the last striker in the previous round to the first striker of the next
   round. This will result in the player having two turns consecutively,
   although in different rounds.

   - If the first turn of the consecutive turns of the player ends in a foul,
     they can't request themselves to play again on the second turn.

   - If the second turn of the consecutive turns of the player begins in a foul,
     both non-offenders will receive the penalty points instead of the previous
     (i.e. the same) player alone.

#. If a player drops out (see `End of Frame`_) or concedes (see `Conceding`_),
   the order of play is no longer changed, and the two remaining players
   continue the frame according to regular snooker rules to determine their
   respective place.

Penalty Points
--------------

Penalty points are awarded to *the previous non-offending striker* after these
infringements:

#. Foul on the *first stroke* of a *turn*, except in cases described below.

Penalty points are awarded to *both non-offending players* after these
infringements:

#. Foul on the *first stroke* of the *frame*.

#. Foul on the *second and subsequent strokes* of a *turn*.

#. Foul on any stroke of a turn where the player has been requested to play
   again after a foul.

#. Foul on any stroke of a turn that is the second consecutive turn of the
   offending player, due to a change in order of play.

#. Penalties.


Play Again
----------

Once a player has been requested to play again after a foul, it will result in
an *additional turn*. There may be an indefinite number of additional play again
turns in a round.

If the first player of a round requests the offender (the last player of the
previous round) to play again, the additional turn occurs at the beginning of
the round, and does not impact the order of play of the current round.

Foul and a Miss
---------------

There is no miss rule.

End of Frame
------------

When black is the only object ball remaining on the table, and the player in the
last place is more than seven points behind the player in the second place, the
player in the last place automatically drops out of the frame as the loser. If
it is during their turn, they drop out after they've finished the turn.

When black is the only object ball remaining on the table, and the player in the
first place is more than seven points ahead the player in the second place, the
player in the first place automatically drops out of the frame as the winner. If
it is during their turn, they drop out after they've finished the turn.

When the winner or loser has been determined, either by dropping out as
described above or by concession (see `Conceding`_), the remaining two players
continue the frame according to regular snooker rules to determine their
respective place.

In case of re-spotted black, only the players with equal scores participate.

Conceding
---------

The player in the last place may concede the frame, dropping out of the frame as
the loser. This may not happen when it is their turn.

The players in the second and last places may together and unanimously concede
the frame to the player in the first place, and continue to play for the second
and last places. This may not happen during the turn of the player in the first
place.

Concession may not happen during the impacted player's turn, including before
the first strike of their turn, to ensure each player knows who is going to play
after them.

After concession, the remaining two players continue the frame according to
regular snooker rules to determine their respective place (see `End of Frame`_).


Playing Out of Turn
-------------------

Playing out of turn is a foul. Playing out of turn incurs seven penalty points
to both the non-offending players.

Any ball(s) moved shall be replaced to their position prior to the infringement,
and the striker's turn will continue unaffected.

It is all players' responsibility to ensure correct order of play is maintained,
and to warn any player apparently about to play out of turn.

Rationale (Informative)
-----------------------

This section is not part of the rules, but describes some of the rationale
behind the rules.

The idea with the order of play is to be able to lay snookers or play good
safety shots to the player ahead of you.

Penalty points after a snooker or a safety shot are awarded to the player who
laid the snooker or played the safety. This approximates "earning" those penalty
points, although obviously the foul may also be an accident.

Strategy (Informative)
----------------------

This section is not part of the rules, but describes some strategic ideas.

It is often better to err on the side of potting than on safety play. Safety
typically benefits the player whose turn is before you (assuming the order does
not change).

While laying a snooker is tempting, and may be required sometimes, a better
safety shot might be one where the player after you is unable to pot, but is
able to play a good safety shot.

If you're last, and far behind the player in the first place, the goal should
shift from trying to win to avoiding losing. Especially so if snookers are
required to reach the first place, as you can only lay snookers to the player in
the second place.
